Templates following <a href = "https://blog.totalcross.com/en/material-o-layout-da-google/" target="_black">Quanter Paper aka Material Design</a>, Google's design pattern according to the  <a href = "https://material.io/resources/color/#!/?view.left=0&view.right=1" target="_black">Material Colors tool</a>

The Material has a number of standards that must be followed and that TotalCross already implements in its components but there is the UI design part, which encompasses colors, component spacing and overall layout. To understand how to apply this pattern to totalcross, click <a href = "https://totalcross.gitbook.io/playbook/guideline/colors-fonts-and-images" target="_black">here</a>.

This project contains 3 samples, all based on Material Color Tools. To use it in your project, simply choose the sample that suits you best and adapt to the colors and images of your project through the <code>Colors.java</code> and <code>Images.java</code> class.
